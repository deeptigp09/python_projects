# Superstore Customer Data Analysis

This project analyzes customer data from a superstore using Python and various data science techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about customer purchases.

## Overview

The analysis covers several key steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   - Handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

2. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary):
   - Segmentation of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

3. Clustering with K-Means:
   - Using scaled RFM data to cluster customers into groups for targeted marketing.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Assessing clustering performance using SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) and Silhouette Score.

5. Data Visualization:
   - Utilizing box plots and scatter plots to visualize data distributions and clustering results.

- `OnlineRetail.xlsx`: Excel file containing the raw dataset used for analysis.

## Libraries Used
