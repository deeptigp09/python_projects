# Weather Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a time series dataset containing hourly information about weather conditions at a specific location. The dataset includes key parameters such as Date/Time, Temperature in Celsius, Dew Point Temperature in Celsius, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed in km/h, Visibility in km, and Pressure in kPa. The data is provided in CSV format.

## Dataset Information
- **Date/Time:** Timestamp for each hourly record.
- **Temperature:** Temperature in Celsius.
- **Dew Point Temperature:** Dew Point Temperature in Celsius.
- **Relative Humidity:** Percentage of relative humidity.
- **Wind Speed:** Wind Speed in km/h.
- **Visibility:** Visibility in km.
- **Pressure:** Atmospheric pressure in kPa.

## Analysis Approach
The primary tool for analyzing this dataset is the Pandas Data Frame in Python. Pandas provides powerful and flexible data structures, making it well-suited for time series analysis. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the weather data.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-dataset.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. **Explore the Data:**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Load the dataset
     weather_data = pd.read_csv('weather_dataset.csv')
     ```

   - Start exploring and analyzing the data using Pandas functionalities.
